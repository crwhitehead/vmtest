# VMTEST - Virtual Machine Detection Tool

A comprehensive toolkit for detecting virtualized environments through timing, scheduling, cache, and memory measurements based on peer-reviewed academic research.

## Overview

VMTEST implements state-of-the-art virtual machine detection techniques validated by academic research, achieving up to 97%+ detection accuracy. The tool performs statistical analysis on various system behaviors that differ between physical and virtual machines, focusing on measurements that are difficult for hypervisors to mask or modify.

## Key Features

- **Research-Based Detection**: Implements techniques from peer-reviewed papers with published accuracy rates
- **Statistical Analysis**: Uses variance, coefficient of variation, skewness, and kurtosis to detect VM-specific patterns
- **Cross-Platform**: Available in both Python and C implementations
- **No Dependencies**: Python version runs without numpy/scipy; C version uses only standard libraries
- **Comprehensive Measurements**: Analyzes timing, scheduling, cache behavior, and memory patterns
- **JSON Output**: Standardized output format for easy integration and analysis

## Measurement Categories

### 1. Thread Scheduling Analysis (97%+ Accuracy)
Based on **Lin, Z., Yang, X., & Zhang, D. (2021)**. "Detection of Virtual Machines Based on Thread Scheduling" 

**Key measurements:**
- `SCHEDULING_THREAD_VARIANCE`: Higher in VMs due to two-level scheduling
- `SCHEDULING_THREAD_CV`: Coefficient of variation for normalization
- `SCHEDULING_THREAD_SKEWNESS`: Lower in VMs (distribution shape)
- `SCHEDULING_THREAD_KURTOSIS`: Lower in VMs (tail behavior)
- `PHYSICAL_MACHINE_INDEX`: Composite metric (PMI < 1.0 indicates VM)

**Research Quote**: *"The probability distribution of execution time of a piece of CPU-bound code in virtual machines has higher variance along with lower kurtosis and skewness"*

### 2. Basic Timing Measurements (80-90% Accuracy)
Based on **Franklin, J., et al. (2008)**. "Remote detection of virtual machine monitors with fuzzy benchmarking"

**Key measurements:**
- `TIMING_BASIC_MEAN`: Average execution time for CPU-bound operations
- `TIMING_BASIC_VARIANCE`: Timing consistency analysis
- `TIMING_BASIC_CV`: Normalized timing variations
- `TIMING_CONSECUTIVE_MEAN`: Overhead in consecutive operations

### 3. Cache Behavior Analysis (85-90% Accuracy)
Based on **Zhang, N., et al. (2020)**. "Detecting hardware-assisted virtualization with inconspicuous features"

**Key measurements:**
- `CACHE_ACCESS_RATIO`: Ratio of cache-unfriendly to cache-friendly access times
- `CACHE_MISS_RATIO`: Normalized difference indicating cache efficiency

**Research Insight**: VMs show different cache patterns due to additional page table layers and context switches.

### 4. Memory Address Entropy (70-85% Accuracy)
Based on **Shacham, H., et al. (2004)**. "On the effectiveness of address-space randomization"

**Key measurements:**
- `MEMORY_ADDRESS_ENTROPY`: Shannon entropy of memory allocation patterns

**Research Insight**: VMs often have reduced ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) entropy.

### 5. Multiprocessing Patterns
Extension of thread scheduling research to process-level analysis:
- `SCHEDULING_MULTIPROC_CV`: Process scheduling variations
- `SCHEDULING_MULTIPROC_SKEWNESS`: Process timing distribution shape
- `SCHEDULING_MULTIPROC_KURTOSIS`: Process timing distribution tail behavior
- `MULTIPROC_PHYSICAL_MACHINE_INDEX`: PMI calculated for process scheduling
- Similar statistical patterns to thread scheduling, validates findings at process level

## Installation and Usage

### Python Version

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.6+
- psutil (optional, for system information)
- No numpy/scipy required!

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run with default 1000 iterations
python3 vmtest.py

# Run with custom iterations
python3 vmtest.py 5000
```

### C Version

**Compilation:**
```bash
# Linux (may need -lrt on older systems)
gcc -o vmtest vmtest.c -lpthread -lm -lrt -O2

# macOS
gcc -o vmtest vmtest.c -lpthread -lm -O2

# If -lrt causes issues, try without it
gcc -o vmtest vmtest.c -lpthread -lm -O2
```

**Usage:**
```bash
./vmtest
```

## Output Format

Both versions produce JSON output with three main sections:

```json

  "system_info": {
    "platform": "Linux 5.15.0",
    "cpu_count": 8,
    "memory_total": 17179869184,

  }
}
```

## VM Detection Indicators

The tool analyzes five primary indicators:

1. **High Scheduling Variance** (CV > 0.15)
   - Most reliable indicator based on Lin et al. research
   - Caused by two-level scheduling in virtualized environments

2. **Low Thread Physical Machine Index** (PMI < 1.0)
   - Composite metric: log(Kurtosis Ã— Skewness / Variance)
   - Strong indicator validated by research for thread scheduling

3. **Low Multiprocess Physical Machine Index** (PMI < 1.0)
   - Same calculation applied to process-level scheduling
   - Validates thread findings at a different scheduling level

4. **High Cache Miss Ratio** (> 0.5)
   - VMs show different cache behavior due to virtualization overhead
   - Additional page table layers affect cache performance

5. **Low Memory Entropy** (< 2.0)
   - Reduced randomness in memory allocation patterns
   - Often indicates restricted ASLR in VMs

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Hardware Dependency**: Results vary based on CPU architecture and system load
2. **Modern Hypervisors**: Newer virtualization technologies may evade some detection methods
3. **Container Detection**: Designed for VMs, not containers (Docker, LXC)
4. **Statistical Nature**: Results are probabilistic, not deterministic
5. **Evasion**: Sophisticated VMs may implement countermeasures
